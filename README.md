# mobile-review-website-using-php-mysql
a mobile phone review website.
I have only added login, sign up and some default review. revirew are not taken from the database. login and sign up are connected though. 
keep the login,signup and test php filein the same folder.
also make folder named frontpage and reviewpage on the same file.all the necessary pics present in the code are available in those folder.
good luck my friend.
