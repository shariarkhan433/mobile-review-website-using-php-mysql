# mobile-review-website-using-php-mysql
A mobile phone review website.
It is nearly a full working website with working admin panel. Apache database has been used to fetch the review and the data. Though there isn't any security layer in between pages, im planing to work on that soon. 
As I have used pure PHP to build this website, i could not worked on the design very well. im also planning to use laravel in the future extension.
